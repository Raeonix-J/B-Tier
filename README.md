**Developer:** Frozenbyte

## 📊 Tier System Reference

| Tier | Meaning |
|----|-------|
| Tier Z | Genre-defining masterpieces |
| Tier S | Near-perfect execution |
| Tier A | Excellent with minor flaws |
| **Tier B** | **Good, but compromised** |
| Tier C | Average |
| Tier E | Poor |
| Tier F | Fundamentally broken |

## 🧠 Why Trine 3 Is NOT S Tier

### 1. Ambition vs Execution

**What it aimed for:**
- Full 3D puzzles
- Physics-driven exploration
- Retaining Trine’s cooperative identity

**What actually happened:**
- Simpler puzzles
- Reduced mechanical depth
- Limited exploration freedom

The ambition was S Tier.  
The execution was not.

---

### 2. Gameplay & Mechanics

| Aspect | Evaluation |
|-----|-----------|
Wizard physics | Weakened |
Knight combat | Simplified |
Thief traversal | Still enjoyable |
Puzzle complexity | Reduced |
Co-op synergy | Less impactful |

The transition to 3D reduced the layered puzzle-solving that defined
earlier Trine games.

---

### 3. Level Design & Pacing

- Levels are noticeably shorter
- Fewer “aha” puzzle moments
- Exploration feels constrained despite 3D space

The game looks large but plays small.

---

### 4. Story & Scope Completion (Major Issue)

- Narrative ends abruptly
- Key story threads remain unresolved
- The game does not feel fully finished

This was later acknowledged by the developers themselves.

An incomplete experience cannot be placed in S Tier.

---

## 🎨 Where Trine 3 Excels (S-Tier Strengths)

- Art direction
- Lighting and visual effects
- Soundtrack and atmosphere
- World aesthetics

If evaluated purely on presentation, Trine 3 would rank extremely high.
However, visuals cannot fully compensate for gameplay shortcomings.

---

## ❤️ Why Many Players Feel It’s S Tier (And That’s Valid)

- Strong emotional impact
- Beautiful environments
- Nostalgia for the Trine universe
- Respect for its ambition

Emotionally: S Tier  
Structurally: B Tier  

Both perspectives can coexist.

---

## 🧩 Lessons for Game Designers

Trine 3 is a valuable case study for developers:

- Major dimensional shifts require deep redesign, not adaptation
- Visual upgrades do not guarantee deeper gameplay
- Scope management is critical
- A finished experience matters as much as ambition

For aspiring game developers, this game offers more learning value
than many flawless titles.

---

## 📌 Conclusion

**Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power** is not a failure.

It is:
- A bold experiment
- A beautiful world
- A compromised execution
- A solid **Tier B** experience

This analysis aims to respect the game while remaining honest.
